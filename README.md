# FESM
Cloud database for file exploring
- As a user you can add files and monitor them. 
- The info from the files can also be stored in private explorers. 
- You can list, add tags, categories and complete additional data or correct it if its added wrong by the image recognition.
- Has sharing options to specific users.
- You can create 'parties' (i.e have more people access the same exploring tree).
- The creator of the party is the owner. He can give permissions to the others (i.e as a user you can only read the files, higher rated users can read write delete e.g linux file system)
