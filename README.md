- As a user you can add files and monitor them. The info from the files can also be stores so you can search by data. You can list, add tags, categories and complete additional data or correct it.
- Its shareable and you can give access to other users. You can assign an owner to have more permissions. (i.e as a user you can only read the files, higher rated users can read write delete e.g linux file system)
